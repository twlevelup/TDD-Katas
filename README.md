This folder contains the resources for a number of different JavaScript TDD Katas. They are intended as an introduction to TDD and pairing for LevelUp Build events.

To get them running you will need to serve the root directory of the repo.

An easy way to do this with Node is:

        npm install -g http-server
        cd TDD-Katas
        http-server
        
Now open one of the kata:
-  [Calculator kata](localhost:8080/katas/calculator)
-  [Triangle kata](localhost:8080/katas/triangle)
